# Measuring-Distance-with-Raspberry-Pi
This helps in calculating the distance of an object using ultrasonic sensor and Raspberry Pi

Connect VCC with Vcc pin of Pi

Connect Ground with Gnd pin

Connect Trig with pin 23 of Board and Echo with Pin 24. 

There are two pieces of code. One will give continuous readings while the other will give a single reading in a second. The range of distance sensor is 200 cm.
